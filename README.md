# MetroNavigationApp
The Metro Navigation App is a Java-based application that helps users find the shortest routes between stations in a metro system. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue for efficient pathfinding and provides options to display all stations, calculate shortest distances, and estimate travel times
